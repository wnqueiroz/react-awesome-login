# 🤝Welcome to React Awesome Login Contributor Session! 

Hi **Contributor**!<br/>
Is your first time in here? If you want to learn about how to **contribute** to this repository, this is the right place. Just read me!<br/>

Next, we'll have a **step by step** to follow, I hope you don't get bothered, but we need this to establish a **good codebase** and a **great maintenance**. There's good reasons to have this _measures_, and plenty of material talking about git best practices (if you want to checkout some of these, [here's a good place to start with](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/)).

## 🍴FORKING IT

Like any other repository, to have your contribution first steps done, you need to **fork Rect Awesome Login** to your github account. Which means you have to **click on fork** in the [repo home page](https://github.com/wnqueiroz/react-awesome-login) and we're done **forking it**.

## 📖BRANCHING

Are you familiar with **branchs**? OMG, we have so much in common!😱<br/>

Our repo follows a template to create branchs, and actually it's very simple. Do you want to `fix` a bug, add some `features`? You need a place that **everyone that is interested in your fix or feature** could have easy access and read **very briefly** information about it .<br/>

And that involves **opening a issue** in github repo page.<br/>
It is a very organized way to **mend all the information** about your fix/feature. Stick with me:<br/>

✔️ open a issue related to the feature/fix and validate <br/>
✔️ create your branch with the issue id, found on URL <br/>
✔️ `git checkout -b <feat or fix>/RAL-<github issue ID>`<br/>

Now, everyone can easily access your branch by reading your issue URL, and vice versa.

>**Branch Example**: fix/RAL-1481
> **ProTip**: if you're in trouble asking yourself **"WHERE IS THIS ISSUE ID?"**, just open your issue, take a look at the URL, is it something like that? `https://github.com/wnqueiroz/react-awesome-login/issues/1481`
>  Probably yes. Just grab the **1481** from the URL, that's your issue ID.

## 🖊️COMMITING

This one's easy. 
You should just commit whenever you feel a **relevant code change** has been made. And obviously, **always** do these _commits_ in the branch you created in the previously step. 

Remember, _keep calm and commit_

## 👨🏻‍💻PULL REQUESTS

Are you anxious already? **It IS TIME!**
As well as commiting, there's no big secrets here. You will...

✔️ push your so **beloved branch**<br/>
✔️ go to your online **forked repo page**<br/>
✔️ open **a pull request** comparing to `develop` <br/>

As soon as it is **REVIEWED** and **APPROVED**, congratulations!🎉
You contributed to React Awesome Login development, we're grateful. Thank you!
